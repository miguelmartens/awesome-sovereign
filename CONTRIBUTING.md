## Guidelines

### What We Include

We focus on tools, services, and resources that support:

- **European cloud providers** and alternatives to hyperscale providers
- **Open source solutions** that promote digital sovereignty
- **Privacy-focused tools** and services
- **Self-hosted alternatives** to proprietary services
- **Decentralized and distributed systems**
- **Tools that reduce vendor lock-in**
- **Solutions that support data sovereignty**

### What We Don't Include

- Proprietary solutions from major hyperscale providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) unless they're specifically designed for sovereign cloud use cases
- Tools that require significant vendor lock-in
- Services that don't respect user privacy or data sovereignty
- Commercial solutions without open source alternatives or transparent pricing

### Quality Standards

- **Active projects**: Tools should be actively maintained or widely used
- **Clear descriptions**: Each entry should have a clear, concise description
- **Working links**: All links should be functional and point to the correct resources
- **Relevance**: Items should be directly relevant to sovereign cloud, open source, or European alternatives
- **Categorization**: Items should be placed in the most appropriate category

## Adding New Items

When adding new items to the list:

1. **Choose the right category** - Place items in the most relevant section
2. **Use consistent formatting** - Follow the existing format: `- [Name](URL) - Description`
3. **Write clear descriptions** - Explain what the tool does and why it's relevant
4. **Verify links** - Ensure all URLs are working and point to the correct resources
5. **Add to appropriate section** - Don't create new categories unless absolutely necessary

### Format for New Entries

```markdown
- [Project Name](https://example.com) - Brief description of what it does and why it's relevant to sovereign cloud
```

### Example

## Removing Items

- No longer exist or are no longer maintained
